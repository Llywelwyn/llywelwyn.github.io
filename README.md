this repo contains the site content hosted on [my website](https://llyw.co.uk/). it's hosted via github pages, built using a static site generator, and deployed via a github workflow. there you can find a WASM version of [RUST-RL](https://github.com/Llywelwyn/rust-rl), my hobby roguelike project in rust using rltk/bracket-lib, some (hopefully educational) blog posts, and a list of miscellaneous links i've found useful or interesting. all related, sometimes only tangentially, to some combination of cs/gamedev/roguelikes.

here's the first post from that website:

what this is?

most of all, this is an educational tool (for myself). there was a blog post i read by
redblobgames at some point that talked about writing things down to better learn them,
and that's my main intention here. if anyone else can benefit from my posts, that's great,
but i don't expect many eyes to end up here, so largely this is just a place for me to make
public all the times i rubber duck at text files to get past a problem.

i've written things down in this format to teach myself before, but it's always messy notes.
i think knowing other people could read what i write will end up being helpful.

in any case, all of that culminates into me saying that none of the solutions here are going
to be perfect, but hopefully they're good enough that if you end up reading this, you can learn
something.

all the code samples here are MIT-licensed unless they say otherwise. that is, do whatever 
you like with them.
