<strong>Project outlines blogpost worksheet</strong>
	<strong>DONE</strong>
		[X] 2023-05-02 Start writing a blog post in outline format instead of regular prose to show what I'm talking about
		[X] 2023-05-02 Extend the blog engine to support outline-format posts
		[X] 2023-05-02 Mark the initial items as done so they show how the "DONE" section gets filled
	[_] Explain that the DONE section is generally always kept folded in the editor
		This way it doesn't clutter the view even with long-lived projects that accrue a very lone done-list
		You should have a text editor that can do indentation-based folds if you work with outline notes
	[_] Figure out an order for the tasks so it makes sense to read out linearly
<strong>Sometimes/maybe TODO items</strong>
	[_] Turn the gimmick project outline into a regular post
		Readers might have a hard time making sense of the outline format
<strong>What's the deal with this anyway?</strong>
	This is an example of a TODO list outline structure used for project management
		Also the first blog post using the outline style described in the <a href="/outline-notes-intro/">outline notes</a> post
	The top of the worksheet, right below the DONE section is a priorized TODO list
	The top item below the DONE list should be the next action for the project
	If it doesn't look like a viable next action, you need to review and update the list
	Worksheet items below it are straightforward high-priority actions
		They should be small, concrete and easy to start
	Future plans go to sections below the worksheet
		These can be much more vague, just a general idea of something to accomplish
		Further details can be written under each task item
	Try to keep the top worksheet at 20-30 items max
		If the item list starts growing out of control, they should be delegated to lower sections as future plans
<strong>Why is this good?</strong>
	DONE list forms a record of what you did on the project
	Next actions focus work, you always have a single concrete thing to start working on next
	20-ish item worksheet list is a manageable scratch space for imminent tasks
	Lower document can be an arbitrarily detailed project plan without weighting down the active TODO list
