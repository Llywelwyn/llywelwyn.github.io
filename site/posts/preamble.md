## what this is

most of all, this is an educational tool (for myself). there was a blog post i read by [redblobgames][redblobgames] at some point that talked about writing things down to better learn them, and that's my main intention here. if anyone else can benefit from my posts, that's great, but i don't expect many eyes to end up here, so largely this is just a place for me to make public all the times i [rubber duck][rubber-duck] at text files to get past a problem.

i've written things down in this format to teach myself before, but it's always messy notes. i think knowing other people _could_ read what i write will end up being helpful.

in any case, all of that culminates into me saying that none of the solutions here are going to be perfect, but hopefully they're good enough that if you end up reading this, you can learn _something_.

all the code samples here are MIT-licensed unless they say otherwise. that is, do whatever you like with them.
