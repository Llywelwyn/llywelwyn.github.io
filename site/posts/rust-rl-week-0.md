*roguelikedev does the complete tutorial* is a yearly sprint hosted by the /r/roguelikedev subreddit, with the aim of giving roguelike devs some encouragement to start a new project and carry it through to an achievable end. it always has a good mix of skill levels - from people setting up their first ide and following a tutorial verbatim, all the way up to people who're already successful in the industry trying out something new.

it has a rough schedule lasting 8 weeks, which consists of 7 weeks of *making stuff* and weekly update posts, followed by an 8th week for everyone to show off what they've got done in the time. i've taken part before privately, but this year i have the free time available to actually follow along with everyone else, so that's what i'll be doing.

### my project for this year - RUST-RL (name NYI)

i wasn't sure what to do this year, because i've already followed along with a couple of the tutorials before, as well as seen projects of my own through to the end, but then i remembered thebracket's [roguelike tutorial in rust][bracket-tutorial], and decided that's where i'll start. it uses ECS, which is great, because it's what i prefer and have the most experience with, and it's data-driven, which is also great, because it means that ultimately i can strip out all of that data and leverage the end result as a really good example of using bracket-lib as, essentially, a game engine.

to begin with, i'm going to be trying my best to stick closely to the content given, partially because i imagine a vast majority of it will end up heavily refactored by the end anyway, and partially because i'd like to stick to a schedule that means i can have something to present by the 8th week of the sprint. i might end up running away with things and diverging entirely, but i'm going to try to refrain and just stick to most of what's written down for as long as i can.

but following on from that, i have a design document all drawn up and ready to go, that i'll start implementing piece-by-piece. maybe i'll start once i finish the content, or maybe just once the 8 weeks of the sprint are up - i'm not sure yet.
